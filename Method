## Data Generation
Bionano Map: Ultra-high molecular weight nuclear DNA (uHMW nDNA) was isolated using a modified version of the Bionano Plant Tissue DNA Isolation Base Protocol (https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/30068-Bionano-Prep-Plant-Tissue-DNA-Isolation-Protocol.pdf). Approximately 0.7–2 g of healthy young leaf tissue was collected from seedlings 2 weeks after germination. Leaf tissue was treated in a 2% formaldehyde fixing solution, washed, diced, and homogenized using a Qiagen TissueRuptor probe. The resultant homogenate was filtered through 100- and 40-µm cell strainers, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 20 minutes. Free nuclei were concentrated by step gradient centrifugation and pelleted by standard centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 minutes. The nuclei pellet was embedded into a low-melting-point agarose plug, followed by treatment with proteinase K and RNase A. Agarose plugs were washed four times in Bionano wash Buffer and five times in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. Purified DNA was recovered by digesting the plug with agarase followed by drop dialysis against TE pH 8.0. 
Direct Label and Stain (DLS) was used in combination with a Bionano Saphyr system to generate chromosome-level optical maps.  Bionano DLS uses the DLE1 enzyme, which labels DNA molecules by recognizing CTTAAG sites and attaching a single fluorophore. DLS was performed using the Bionano Direct Label and Stain Kit (https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/30206-Bionano-Prep-Direct-Label-and-Stain-DLS-Protocol.pdf) with a few modifications. Approximately 1 µg of sorghum uHMW nDNA was mixed with DLE-1 Enzyme, DL-Green label, and DLE-1 Buffer, and then incubated for 2:20 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by incubation for 20 min at 70°C, following by digestion with proteinase K for 1 h at 50 °C. Unincorporated DL-Green label was removed from the reaction by absorption onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The labeled, cleaned-up DNA sample was combined with Flow Buffer, DTT, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and quantified. The DNA backbone was stained by addition of Bionano DNA Stain at a final concentration of 1 microliter per 0.1 microgram of final DNA. Finally, the labeled, cleaned-up, and stained sample was loaded onto a single Bionano chip flow cell. DNA molecules were electrophoretically separated, stretched, imaged, and digitized using the Bionano Genomics Saphyr System and server (https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/30143-Saphyr-System-User-Guide.pdf).

PacBio and 10X Chromium Sequencing Collection
DNA was isolated from approximately 50 g fast-frozen young leaf tissue using a protocol described by Luo and Wing, 2003. Leaf material was ground in liquid nitrogen and incubated for 15 minutes in cold NIB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 500 mM sucrose, 4 mM spermidine trihydrochloride, 1 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride) containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The resultant homogenate was filtered twice through Miracloth and mixed with 5% NIBT (NIB+10% Triton X-100). Free nuclei and cell debris were concentrated by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 15 minutes and washed with NIB+0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol followed by a second centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 15 minutes. The pellet was embedded in LMP agarose plugs, and treated with proteinase K, melted, and digested with agarase. High-speed (30,000 × g) centrifugation cycles were performed to concentrate and remove solids and recover the DNA in the supernatant. 
PacBio library preparation was performed using the Pacific Biosciences SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 following the protocol for > 30-kb libraries (https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Procedure-Checklist-Preparing-HiFi-SMRTbell-Libraries-using-SMRTbell-Template-Prep-Kit-1.0.pdf) with some modifications.  Prior to library construction, the DNA was sheared to approximately 50 kb using a BioRuptor (Diagenode) and pre-sized using the >20-kb high-pass broad-range protocol on a PippinHT (Sage Science). A second size selection for the final library was performed using the >20-kb broad-range PippinHT protocol, followed by a final DNA repair reaction. Quality of DNA at different steps of the process was evaluated using a FEMTO Pulse automated pulsed-field analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Quantification was performed using the Qubit dsDNA BR and HS reagents Assay kits on a Qubit 3.0 system. Sequencing was performed on a PacBio Sequel v6.0 system using 1M v3 SMRT Cells with 3.0 chemistry and diffusion loading.  In total, six SMRT Cells each were used for Tx2783 and RTx436.

Chromium 10X was performed according to standard protocols using a non-sheared aliquot of the DNA used for PacBio library construction. Approximately 1 ng of DNA was loaded with 10X Chromium reagents and gel beads onto a Chromium chip (https://support.10xgenomics.com/de-novo-assembly/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-genome-reagent-kit-v1-chemistry). The Chromium libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 system. For Tx2783, a total of 231,083,110 clusters were obtained, corresponding to 69.8 Mbp or 87× genome coverage. For RTx436, a total of 229,285,050 clusters were obtained, corresponding to 69.3 Mbp or 86× genome coverage. 

Long- and Short-read Sequencing
Long-read data were generated using the Pacific BioSciences (Menlo Park, CA, USA) Sequel platform at Corteva Agriscience (Johnston, IA, USA). Six SMRT cells were sequenced for both samples with 10-hr movies and v6 chemistry. Raw subreads were filtered to a 3-kb minimum for both samples, generating 75× and 64× genome coverage for Tx2783 and RTx436, respectively. The raw subread N50 lengths were 23.1 kb (Tx2783) and 24.7 kb (RTx436).
Linked short-read data were generated by sequencing of 10X Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) Chromium libraries at Corteva Agriscience on the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, California). The Tx2783 Chromium dataset had 76× coverage and mean molecule length of 62,942bp. The coverage depths and mean molecule lengths for the Tx2783 and RTx436 Chromium libraries were 76×/62.9kb and 84×/98.5 kb, respectively.
Genome Assembly and Polishing
Raw PacBio subreads were corrected and assembled using Canu v1.8 (Koren et al., 2017) with the following parameters varying from the defaults: “correctedErrorRate=0.065 corMhapSensitivity=normal ovlMerDistinct=0.99”. The resultant contigs were filtered to a minimum contig length of 30 kb. Beyond the sequence consensus process that Canu performs after assembly, additional sequence polishing was performed by aligning raw PacBio subreads to the contig assembly using pbmm2 v0.12.0 and applying the Arrow algorithm from the Genomic Consensus package (v2.3.2) to get consensus calls. Both of these tools were obtained from pbbioconda (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda). To further increase the consensus sequence accuracy, the long read contig assembly was complemented with Chromium linked short-read “clouds”, which have higher unique mappability than standard Illumina paired-end libraries. Chromium datasets were aligned to sequence contigs with Long Ranger v2.2.2. The assembly improvement tool Pilon v1.22 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon) was used to correct individual base errors and small indels from the consensus of Chromium data aligned to the contigs using the parameter “--fix bases –minmq 30”. To decrease the compute time, a separate Pilon job was run for each contig against Chromium alignments specific to that contig. Contig-specific alignments were created using samtools v1.9 (https://github.com/samtools/samtools) from the Long Ranger output BAM file.
Genome Mapping
Genome maps for Tx2783 and RTx436 were generating on the Bionano Genomics (San Diego, California) Saphyr platform at Corteva Agriscience using the Direct Label and Stain (DLS) system. For Tx2783, DLE-1–labeled molecule data from two flow cells (one chip) were filtered to create a data subset with a molecule N50 of 682 kb and 189× coverage. The filtered molecule dataset for Tx2783 was assembled via the Bionano Genomics Access software platform (Solve3.2.2_08222018) with the configuration file optArguments_nonhaplotype_noES_noCut_DLE1_saphyr.xml. The map assembly for Tx2783 consisted of 27 genome maps with a genome map N50 of 36.9 Mb and a total map length of 732.1 Mb.
For RTx436, DLE-1 labeled molecule data from two flow cells (1 chip) were filtered to create a dataset with a molecule N50 of 441 kb and 267× coverage. The filtered molecule dataset for RTx436 was assembled as described above, generating a map assembly of 28 genome maps with a genome map N50 of 37.7 Mb and a total map length of 723.6 Mb.
Hybrid Scaffolding
An initial hybrid scaffolding was generated from the polished contigs and the Bionano genome maps using the Bionano Genomics Access software (Solve3.3_10252018) and the DLE-1 configuration file hybridScaffold_DLE1_config.xml to identify potentially problematic (smaller maps nearly identical to larger maps, low-coverage) or non-contributing genome maps. After this assessment, 19 genome maps from Tx2783 (Min length = 8.6 Mb) and 18 genome maps for RTx436 (Min length = 8.1 Mb) were selected to generate hybrid scaffolds. As part of the hybrid scaffolding process, chimeric mis-assemblies in the contigs were identified and cut to resolve conflicts relative to the genome maps. In addition to auto-conflict resolution, manual curation was performed to resolve overlapping contigs that were not addressed by the hybrid scaffolding workflow. A list of contig pairs that overlap in map space was generated from the gap file in the hybrid scaffold output directory, yielding 58 (Tx2783) and 51 (RTx436) overlapping pairs. Additional contigs cuts were added to the conflict resolution file to best resolve these issues. Embedded contigs are another assembly issue not resolved by the hybrid scaffolding workflow. A list of contig pairs in which a smaller contig is embedded within a collapsed region of a larger contig was also generated from the gap file in the hybrid scaffold output directory, yielding three (Tx2783) and eight (RTx436) embedded contig pairs. Similarly, additional conflict cuts were made in the larger contig to allow incorporation of the smaller contig after the hybrid scaffolding was re-run. In the final assembly, Tx2783 had 19 hybrid scaffolds (Scaffold N50= 36.0 Mb, Total scaffold length = 696.8 Mb) with 310 unscaffolded contigs with a total length of 27.1 Mb. RTx436 had 18 hybrid scaffolds (Scaffold N50= 37.6 Mb, Total scaffold length= 697.2 Mb) with 325 leftover contigs that were not scaffolded with a combined length of 25.0 Mb).  
Creating Pseudomolecules
With an average of 1.85 hybrid scaffolds per chromosome for the two lines, it is straightforward to create chromosome-scale pseudomolecules using the Sorghum bicolor v3.1 reference genome as a guide (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#!info?alias=Org_Sbicolor). A generalized approach was used that rapidly maps scaffolds to a reference genome and determines their relative position and orientation. First, each scaffold was chunked into 100-bp fragments and then aligned to the Sorghum bicolor v3.1 reference genome using minimap2 v2.10 (Li, 2018). Then, a custom script was used to determine the chromosome position and orientation from the alignment of scaffold “read clouds”. All scaffolds were placed with this method. The remaining unscaffolded contigs were concatenated with 100-bp N-gaps and placed into Chr00.
Integrating Plastid Genomes into the Assembly
It can be challenging to assemble plastid genomes from whole-genome PacBio libraries and distinguish them from plastid DNA integrated into the chromosome. An alternative approach is to insert a copy of an existing plastid genome reference sequence and to remove incomplete plastid assemblies from Chr00.  A copy of the Sorghum bicolor chloroplast complete genome (GenBank: NC_008602.1) and Sorghum bicolor mitochondrion complete genome (GenBank: NC_008360.1) were added to the assembly as ChrC and ChrM, respectively. Only Tx2783 exhibited a SNP or small indel when the Canu-corrected reads were aligned with minimap2 and checked for variants with Pilon, which had a 1-bp deletion relative to the mitochondria reference. A modified version of ChrM incorporating this deletion was added to the TX2783 assembly. Incomplete plastid sequence contigs in Chr00 were identified by BLASTN (-F f -e 1e-200 -W32). Contigs with greater than 99% identity over more than 20 kb relative to the Sorghum bicolor plastid reference genomes were removed from the assembly. Manual curation of both assemblies was performed to fill gaps and better resolve the chromosomal chloroplast insertion on Chr09.
Manual Curation of the SCA Locus
Visual inspection of the hybrid scaffold at the SCA locus revealed an approximately 69.8 kb collapsed repeat in the contig assembly that was not resolved during the initial manual curation process. In addition, alignment of the PacBio corrected reads to the contig assembly similarly showed evidence of a collapsed assembly of approximately 77.7 kb within the QTL locus (i.e. 2× corrected read coverage, soft-clipped reads flanking the potential repeat). The longest corrected reads from a 592-kb target region spanning the QTL region were manually assembled using GeneCodes Sequencher (Ann Arbor, Michigan) to generate a new sequence that resolved the collapsed repeat such that it was congruent to the Bionano map and incorporated the previously soft-clipped reads.  As a result, 70,267 bp were added to the SCA locus. The entire manually curated region was swapped back into the pseudomolecule assembly and subjected to an additional round of sequence polishing with PacBio raw reads and 10X Chromium as described above. This was necessary because the corrected reads were used for the targeted assembly. Finally, the curated and polished 592-kb region was swapped back into the original pseudomolecule assembly. Thus, the final assembly, including the manually curated SCA locus was only subjected to a single round of polishing.  
Annotation of the Tx2783 and RTx436 Assembly
Gene annotations were performed using a strategy that combined evidence-based and ab initio gene predictions (Seetharam et al., 2019). Genome-guided transcript assemblies were performed using transcriptome data from seven tissue types across the juvenile, vegetative, and reproductive stages of development (Supplemental Data S7) using four different assemblers: Trinity (v2.8.4) (Grabherr et al., 2011), StringTie (v1.3.5) (Pertea et al., 2015), Cufflinks (v2.1.1) (Trapnell et al., 2010), and PsiCLASS (v1.0.1) (Song et al., 2019). Representative sets of transcripts were identified and annotated as genes using Mikado (v2.0rc6) (Venturini et al., 2018). High-quality RNA-seq reads from each library were mapped to Tx2783 and RTx436 genomes indexed by STAR (v2.7.0d) (Dobin et al., 2013) using a two-pass mapping approach and default settings. The SAM output from individually mapped RNA-seq libraries was then pooled, sorted, and indexed for transcript assembly programs using Picard (v2.7.0) (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). The transcript assemblers were run using default options, except for Trinity, for which maximum intron size was set to 10000. The transcript assembly fasta file from the Trinity output was converted to GFF3 by aligning the transcripts to indexed genomes with GMAP (v2019-03-15) (Wu et al., 2005) (-f gff3_match_cdna). Portcullis (v1.1.2) (Mapleson et al., 2018) was used to generate high-quality splice junctions from the merged mapped reads. Preliminary transcripts were refined for Mikado by 1) merging all transcripts and removing the redundant copies, 2) processing using TransDecoder (v5.5.0) (Grabherr et al., 2011) (to identify open reading frames), and 3) aligning with BLASTX (v2.2.29+) (Altschul et al., 1997) against SwissProt Viridiplantae proteins (to identify full-length transcripts). Default options were used for TransDecoder. For BLASTX, maximum target sequences were set to 5 and output format to xml. Inputs for Mikado included all transcript assemblies, Portcullis-generated splice sites, and a plants.yaml scoring matrix. The output GFF3 file was used to extract transcripts and proteins using the gffread utility from the Cufflinks package.

Further structural improvements to Mikado-generated transcripts were completed using the PASA (v2.3.3) (Haas et al., 2003) genome annotation tool. The inputs for PASA included 209,835 maize EST derived from GenBank, Mikado-assembled transcripts for Tx2783 and RTx436, 37,655 sorghum iso-seq transcripts from 11 developmental tissues, and 31,881 sorghum full-length cDNAs from RIKEN that were filtered for intron retention (Reddy et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).  PASA was run with default options; in the first step, transcript evidence was aligned to the masked sorghum genomes using GMAP (v2019-03-15) (Wu et al., 2005) and Blat (v.36) (Kent, 2002). The full-length cDNA and Iso-seq transcript IDs were passed in a text file (-f FL.acc.list) during the PASA alignment step. PASA updated the models, providing UTR extensions, as well as novel and additional alternative isoforms. PASA-generated models were passed through the MAKER-P (v3.0) (Campbell et al., 2014) annotation pipeline as model_gff along with all the transcript and protein sequences to yield Annotation Edit Distance (AED) scores to assess the quality of annotations. Transposon element (TE)-related genes were filtered using the TEsorter tool (Zhang et al., 2019), which uses the REXdb (viridiplantae_v3.0 + metazoa_v3) (Neumann et al., 2019) database of TEs. To supplement the evidence annotation, the protein sequences from Mikado transcripts and RNA-seq data were used for ab initio gene model prediction with BRAKER (Hoff et al., 2015). Non-overlapping BRAKER gene models were updated with PASA, filtered for TE-related genes, provided with AED scores using MAKER, and added to the evidence set. We further filtered this combined set with the criterion AED < 0.75, and then applied phylogeny filters by aligning protein sequences to maize, rice, Brachypodium, and Arabidopsis proteins to identify conserved and lineage-specific genes. The genes were loaded in Ensembl core databases and quality-checked to identify transcripts with incomplete CDSs, which were programmatically corrected and also checked for translation errors. Transcripts with complete CDSs were tagged as protein-coding and those with incomplete CDSs as non-coding. Functional annotation was performed using InterProscan-5.38-76.0 (Jones et al., 2014). Canonical assignment of transcripts was performed using a combination of criteria including domain coverage, translation length, and AED scores comparing each transcript to sample specific transcripts assembled with Stringtie. Transcripts were ranked by each criterion, and a canonical transcript was selected by a ranked-choice voting scheme (Olson et al., 2020). The functional and canonical attributes were added to the annotation files, and quality checking was performed using GFF3toolkit (Chen et al., 2019).

Rampage Library Construction, Data Generation and Analysis

This protocol is a modified version of a previously published method (Batut et al., 2013). Prior to incubation with Terminator™ 5′-Phosphate-Dependent Exonuclease (TEX) (Lucigen) to remove all residual RNAs containing 5’ monophosphate, as described in Batut et al., we removed all ribosomal RNAs using the RiboMinus™ Plant Kit for RNA-Seq (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
We then performed first-strand synthesis using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA Kit V2- Pico Input Mammalian (Takara). Following purification with RNAclean XP (Beckman Coulter), 5’ cap oxidation, 5’ cap biotinylation, RNase I digestion, and streptavidin pulldown (Cap Trapping) were performed as described in Batut et al.
Amplification of purified cDNAs (two rounds of PCR to attach Illumina adapters and amplify the libraries) followed by AMPure XP cleanup (Beckman Coulter) was done using the “SMARTer Stranded Total RNA Kit v2” (Takara) according to protocol. All samples were processed separately, quantitated on a 2100 Bioanalyzer using a HS-DNA-Chip (Agilent), and adjusted to a concentration of 10 nM. Libraries were then pooled at equimolar concentration and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 Sequencer.
RAMPAGE reads were aligned to the reference using STAR 2.7 on SciApps (Wang et al., 2018). The mapped reads from each tissue were clustered using Paraclu (Frith et al., 2008) . The BAM alignment files from STAR were converted to BED using the bamtobed tool and grouped using the groupBy tool from BEDTools v2.29.2 (Aaron et al., 2010) to sum up reads that started at the same position and on the same strand as the input to Paraclu.  Paraclu was run with default settings with the minimal number of reads to form a cluster; -minValue was set to 10. The paraclu-cut.sh script within Paraclu was used to simplify and remove clusters with length > 200, max density/min density < 2, or that were contained within another cluster. Peaks with the clusters were identified using scripts provided in this Github repository : https://github.com/davetang/paraclu_prep. TSS profile plots for scores over the TSS region using an annotated 5’ UTR were generated using deeptools2 (Ramirez et al., 2016).
SV Detection
All available genomes were aligned to the sorghum Tx2783 genome using MUMmer 4 (Marcais et al., 2018) with default parameters. Plots of the alignment only used the one-to-one alignment. SNP and small indels (<50 bp) were also called by the tool “show-snp” in the MUMmer 4 package. Large indels and inversions were called using the SVMU pipeline (Chakraborty et al., 2019). Insertions and deletions (>50 bp) with any overlap with the gap region in the reference genome were filtered out. Functional annotation of SNPs was performed using SnpEff (Cingolani et al., 2012) based on the Tx2783 genome annotation. SIFT 4G (Vaser et al., 2016) was used to predict deleterious mutations through the SciApps platform (Wang et al., 2018).

Pan-Genome Construction and Resequencing Data Analysis
 
The pan-genome was constructed using Tx2783 as backbone, with the addition of the sequence of insertions which were called from the other four complete genomes. Resequencing data from Mace et al. 2013 and 17 BAP/SAP lines (https://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/terraref) were used for population analysis. Three lines (KS115; Yik.solate; Kilo) were removed due to low gene coverage; the remaining 61 genomes were mapped to this pan-genome using the BWA software (Li et al., 2009a). SAMtools (Li et al., 2009b) was used to convert mapping results to bam format. On one hand, BEDTools v2.29.2 (Aaron et al., 2010) was used to convert the bam files to bed format and calculate the gene coverage from the reads across 62 genomes. Next, core, soft core, dispensable and private genes were identified under three different cutoffs based on coverage: 50%; 75% and 90%; On the other hand, bam alignments were converted to pileup format using the pileup command. SNPs were called using both minimum base quality threshold and minimum mapping quality of 20. We then used vcf2phylip v2.0 (Ortiz, 2019) to convert the VCF to Phylip format, and then the   python   script   ascbias.py (https://github.com/btmartin721/raxml_ascbias) was   used   to   remove   sites   considered   as invariable by RAxML. Finally, RAxML-NG (Kozlov et al., 2019) was used to estimate the best ML tree, then the bootstraps were used to plot support on the best tree.

Gene Tree and Synteny Analysis

Protein-coding genes annotated on five assembled sorghum accessions, and gene models from outgroup species (Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Vitis vinifera, Arabidopsis thaliana, Selaginella Moellendorffii, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) were used to generate gene trees (Herrero et al., 2016). Using the gene trees, pairs of syntenic orthologs were identified between sorghum accessions. Syntenic and non-syntenic genes in the pan-genome (core, soft core, dispensable and private) were tabulated by comparing set membership. Genes in the pan-genome were also classified according to the taxonomic origin of the corresponding gene family.

Identification of NLR Loci and Gene Expression Analysis
Genome-wide nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) loci were annotated using NLR-Annotator (Steuernagel et al., 2020), and loci that overlapped with genes were extracted using BEDTools (Quinlan et al., 2010). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) (Letunic et al., 2019). Illumina raw reads from Tetreault et al (Tetreault et al., 2019) were aligned to the Tx2783 reference genome using STAR with a minimum intron length set to 20 bp and a maximum intron length set to 50 kb, with default settings for other parameters. Quantification of genes and isoforms was performed using cufflinks version 2.2.1. A k-means approach was used [R Bioconductor package ‘Mfuzz’ (Kumar et al., 2007) to cluster dynamically expressed genes based on their expression profiles across different time points after sugarcane aphid infestation. 

Identification of the SCA Resistance Locus
To identify the SCA resistance locus, the two parental lines Tx2783 and BTx623 and two pools from a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, one consisting of 20 SCA-resistant individuals and the other consisting of 20 SCA-sensitive individuals, were sequenced on the Illumina platform. The average sequencing depth was about 10×. Bowtie2 (Langmead et al., 2012) was used to align the reads to the sorghum BTx623 v3.1.1 reference genome in ‘--very-sensitive’ mode. Duplicates from sequencing were masked using Picard tools (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). After alignment, variations in the four samples were called by samtools (Li et al., 2009), using only reads with sequencing and alignment quality above 20. Only sites sequenced in all four samples were considered for the subsequent analysis. Candidate variations were required to meet the following criteria: 1) homozygous in all four samples; 2) different genotypes in the two parental lines; 3) BTx623 and Tx2783 genotype in the sensitive and resistant pools, respectively. The effects of the remaining variants were then predicted by SNPeff (Cingolani et al., 2012). Only variations annotated with MISSENSE, NONSENSE, or SPLICE_SITE_ACCEPTOR/DONOR effects were considered to be large-effect variations. The variations remaining as candidates were counted in 100-kb sliding windows with a step size of 10 kb.
